# SmartFlow Traffic Manager

STM is a system that is responsible for predicting traffic flow to solve congestion problems and suggest alternate routes. It also controls the traffic lights using AI to optimize the singla timing based on traffic conditions. STM helps in finding accidents and alerting the users so that any emergency measures can be taken as early as possible. Along with this it gives smart parking solutions, traffic camera analytics, dashboards, sharing traffic data among others, optimizing public transportations and prioritizing emergency vehicles.

**User**: City traffic management authority.

**Goal**: Efficiently manage and optimize urban traffic flow using the SmartFlow Traffic Manager system.

## Services

SmartFlow Traffic Manager has the following features to help and improve traffic management -

**Dashboard Access:** The user logs into the SmartFlow Traffic Manager dashboard using secure credentials.

**Real-Time Overview:** Upon logging in, the user is presented with a real-time overview of current traffic conditions, highlighted on an interactive map. The map displays live camera feeds from key intersections.

**Predictive Analytics:** The user explores predictive analytics features to anticipate traffic conditions for the upcoming hours. The system provides insights into potential congestion points based on historical data, events, and weather forecasts.

**Traffic Signal Control:** To optimize traffic signal timings, the user navigates to the "Dynamic Control" module. Here, the system suggests adaptive signal timings based on real-time traffic data. The user can approve and implement these suggestions to improve traffic flow.

**Incident Management:** In the event of an incident, the system automatically detects anomalies and alerts the user. The user accesses incident details, such as accident locations and suggested alternative routes, and can disseminate this information to relevant authorities and the public.

**Parking Solutions:** Using the "SmartPark" module, the user checks the predicted parking space availability in different areas of the city. This information can be used to guide users to available parking spaces, reducing traffic caused by drivers searching for parking.

**Collaborative Data Sharing:** The user participates in collaborative data sharing by accessing the "Data Exchange" platform. Here, they can securely share and receive traffic information with neighboring cities or transportation agencies.

**Connected Vehicles Integration:** The user monitors connected vehicles on the "Connected Vehicles" module, receiving real-time data on their location and speed. This information is used to enhance overall traffic predictions and optimize signal timings dynamically.

**Public Transportation Optimization:** To improve public transportation efficiency, the user navigates to the "Public Transit" module. The system suggests optimized schedules based on demand, helping to reduce congestion around transit hubs.

**Emergency Vehicle Priority:** In emergency situations, the user relies on the "Emergency Priority" feature. The system detects approaching emergency vehicles, adjusts traffic signals to prioritize their movement, and provides a clear path for faster response times.

**Performance Analytics:** The user assesses the overall performance of the traffic management system using the "Analytics" section. Key metrics, such as reduction in congestion, response times to incidents, and overall traffic flow improvements, are presented for evaluation.

**User Collaboration:** The user collaborates with other traffic management authorities and planners through the system's communication features, sharing insights, best practices, and collectively working towards improving regional traffic management.

## Product Goals

**Traffic Dashboard:** User can see the dashboard of current traffic conditions like each vehicle count on each hour of the day, pedestrian count on each hour, congestion areas, incidents, vehicles and pedestrian count on each direction of the road.

**Real-Time Overview:** User can see the real-time view of the video feed coming from a camera along with a map beside it. The video feed will also show the vehicles and pedestrains being detected in real-time, whereas in the map vehicles will be seen as points and user can see the route of those vehicles in the map.

**Predict Traffic Flow:** User can access the predictions of the traffic conditions like the vehicle count, pedestrian count, congestion areas and incidents. It shows user how many vehicles will be seen for next few hours, how much pedestrian will be seen for the next hours, whether their are any possibility of congestion and in which route that congestion will happen, is there any possibility of accidents in any route etc. User also has choice on whether they actually experienced the forecasting or not and with how much accuracy, it works as a feedback to our system.

**Dynamic Traffic Signal:** System gives traffic signals based on the data it is provided and getting every hour. After getting the traffic signal from the signal, user can apply that suggestion to real-time or it can skip it in case user thinks the signal is not the optimized one based on the current situation.

**Traffic Accident Management:** User can get real-time alerts in case any accident is noticed by the system along with information of that accident like location, best route to reach that location. User also has options of sharing this data with responsible authorities or hospitals so that victims can be taken care of immediately.

**Effective Parking Solutions:** User will get information regarding the available parking areas in the road and help them give this information to drivers who are finding areas to park their vehicle.

**Traffic Data Sharing:** Users can share the traffic data with other respective users of the system informing them of the congestion areas, traffic volume, other possible routes to avoid congestion, accidents, parking areas etc.

**Public Tranportation Optimization:** User who is not traffic authority but have public transport medium like truck, bus can see the routes that has less congestion and also times of the day when those routes have less congestion. This will help users to take better low congestion routes and choose time when there is less congestion.

**Emergency Vehicle Detection:** User can detect the emergency vehicles, that need immediate measures to go somewhere, and based on the traffic conditions it either provides them better route or controls the traffic signal according to the situation.
