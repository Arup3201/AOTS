# SmartFlow Traffic Manager

STM is a system that is responsible for predicting traffic flow to solve congestion problems and suggest alternate routes. It also controls the traffic lights using AI to optimize the singla timing based on traffic conditions. STM helps in finding accidents and alerting the users so that any emergency measures can be taken as early as possible. Along with this it gives smart parking solutions, traffic camera analytics, dashboards, sharing traffic data among others, optimizing public transportations and prioritizing emergency vehicles.

## System Features

SmartFlow Traffic Manager has the following features to help and improve traffic management using AI -

**Predictive Traffic Flow Analysis:**
- **Task:** Use machine learning algorithms to predict traffic patterns based on historical data, events, and weather conditions. Provide real-time predictions for traffic congestion and suggest alternative routes.
- **Implementation:** Train a simple regression model to predict traffic conditions based on time, day of the week, and historical traffic data.

**Dynamic Traffic Signal Control:**
- **Task:** Implement adaptive traffic signal control systems using reinforcement learning. Optimize signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions, reducing congestion and improving traffic flow.
- **Implementation:** Develop a basic simulation environment (using Python) to model traffic intersections. Apply simple reinforcement learning algorithms to adjust signal timings based on current traffic conditions.

**Anomaly Detection and Incident Management:**
- **Task:** Utilize AI for anomaly detection to identify accidents, road closures, or other incidents. Automatically alert authorities and update navigation systems with alternative routes.
- **Implementation:** Implement statistical methods or machine learning algorithms (e.g., isolation forests) to detect anomalies in traffic patterns, signaling potential incidents.

**Smart Parking Solutions:**
- **Task:** Integrate AI to analyze parking space availability and guide drivers to the nearest available parking. Implement predictive models to estimate parking demand based on historical data.
- **Implementation:** Use machine learning to analyze historical parking data and predict parking space availability. Display predictions through a simple web or mobile application.

**Traffic Camera Analytics:**
- **Task:** Use computer vision algorithms to analyze camera feeds for real-time traffic monitoring. Identify and respond to illegal parking, traffic violations, and other issues.
- **Implementation:** Use open-source computer vision libraries (e.g., OpenCV) to detect simple traffic conditions, such as congestion or illegal parking, from camera feeds.

**Intelligent Traffic Management Dashboard:**
- **Task:** Develop a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into traffic conditions, predictions, and incident reports. Enable real-time collaboration and decision-making for traffic management authorities.
- **Implementation:** Use web development tools (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to build a dashboard that displays real-time and historical traffic data in a user-friendly format.

**Collaborative Traffic Data Sharing:**
- **Task:** Implement a secure and anonymized data-sharing platform for different traffic management systems to exchange information. Foster collaboration among cities and regions to optimize traffic management on a broader scale.
- **Implementation:** Create a basic web-based platform using common web development tools and ensure secure data exchange between different traffic management systems.

**Integration with Connected Vehicles:**
- **Task:** Connect with AI-equipped vehicles to exchange real-time data on their location, speed, and traffic conditions. Use this data to improve traffic predictions and optimize signal timings dynamically.
- **Implementation:** Use networking concepts to establish communication between a simple vehicle simulation (perhaps using Python) and the traffic management system.

**Public Transportation Optimization:**
- **Task:** Implement AI algorithms to optimize public transportation schedules based on demand and real-time conditions. Provide real-time updates to commuters on bus/train delays and alternative routes.
- **Implementation:** Use optimization algorithms (e.g., linear programming) to create efficient schedules for buses or trains based on demand and real-time conditions.

**Emergency Vehicle Priority:**
- **Task:** Integrate AI to recognize emergency vehicles and adjust traffic signals to prioritize their movement. Improve response times for emergency services during critical situations.
- **Implementation:** Use image processing techniques to identify emergency vehicles from camera feeds and modify signal timings accordingly.
