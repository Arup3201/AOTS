# SmartFlow Traffic Manager

STM is a system that is responsible for predicting traffic flow to solve congestion problems and suggest alternate routes. It also controls the traffic lights using AI to optimize the singla timing based on traffic conditions. STM helps in finding accidents and alerting the users so that any emergency measures can be taken as early as possible. Along with this it gives smart parking solutions, traffic camera analytics, dashboards, sharing traffic data among others, optimizing public transportations and prioritizing emergency vehicles.

**User**: City traffic management authority.

**Goal**: Efficiently manage and optimize urban traffic flow using the SmartFlow Traffic Manager system.

## Services

SmartFlow Traffic Manager has the following features to help and improve traffic management -

**Dashboard Access:**

The user logs into the SmartFlow Traffic Manager dashboard using secure credentials.

**Real-Time Overview:**

Upon logging in, the user is presented with a real-time overview of current traffic conditions, highlighted on an interactive map. The map displays congestion areas, incidents, and live camera feeds from key intersections.

**Predictive Analytics:**

The user explores predictive analytics features to anticipate traffic conditions for the upcoming hours or days. The system provides insights into potential congestion points based on historical data, events, and weather forecasts.

**Traffic Signal Control:**

To optimize traffic signal timings, the user navigates to the "Dynamic Control" module. Here, the system suggests adaptive signal timings based on real-time traffic data. The user can approve and implement these suggestions to improve traffic flow.

**Incident Management:**

In the event of an incident, the system automatically detects anomalies and alerts the user. The user accesses incident details, such as accident locations and suggested alternative routes, and can disseminate this information to relevant authorities and the public.

**Parking Solutions:**

Using the "SmartPark" module, the user checks the predicted parking space availability in different areas of the city. This information can be used to guide users to available parking spaces, reducing traffic caused by drivers searching for parking.

**Collaborative Data Sharing:**

The user participates in collaborative data sharing by accessing the "Data Exchange" platform. Here, they can securely share and receive traffic information with neighboring cities or transportation agencies.

**Connected Vehicles Integration:**

The user monitors connected vehicles on the "Connected Vehicles" module, receiving real-time data on their location and speed. This information is used to enhance overall traffic predictions and optimize signal timings dynamically.

**Public Transportation Optimization:**

To improve public transportation efficiency, the user navigates to the "Public Transit" module. The system suggests optimized schedules based on demand, helping to reduce congestion around transit hubs.

**Emergency Vehicle Priority:**

In emergency situations, the user relies on the "Emergency Priority" feature. The system detects approaching emergency vehicles, adjusts traffic signals to prioritize their movement, and provides a clear path for faster response times.

**Performance Analytics:**

The user assesses the overall performance of the traffic management system using the "Analytics" section. Key metrics, such as reduction in congestion, response times to incidents, and overall traffic flow improvements, are presented for evaluation.

**User Collaboration:**

The user collaborates with other traffic management authorities and planners through the system's communication features, sharing insights, best practices, and collectively working towards improving regional traffic management.

## Problem Framing

- **Traffic Dashboard:**
  
  - *Goal:* Show the authorities condition of traffic. Like, 
    
    - Today's total traffic count
    
    - Time-series data of traffic count
    
    - Total Pedestrians coming and going
    
    - Each category vehicle data
    
    - Traffic flow in each direction

- **Real-Time Overview:**
  
  - *Goal:* Show authorities the view of the vehicles and their route. Along with this video feed where vehicles are detected using machine learning, we are also showing a map indicating the path of each of these vehicles.
  
  - *ML Problem Framing 1:* Model will learn from images to detect the vehicles in the image and use a bounding box to cover the vehicle detected. Data needed to do this task are available so data will not be an issue. The model that we are going to use is heavy model. So, it will make the process complex and error prone. There will be latency when user actually gets to see the result.

- **Predict Traffic Flow:**
  
  - *Goal:* It will forecast the traffic flow according to previous traffic history. User will be able to see the future traffic flow of next *2* hrs.
  
  - *ML Problem Framing:* Forecast the traffic flow of next *2* hrs by learning from historical traffic flow data. It will output the volume of traffic and show it in the form of a time-series graph.

- **Dynamic Traffic Signal:**
  
  - *Goal:* User will be given suggestions on the optimized singal that should be shown on the road to improve traffic congestion and safety.
  
  - *ML Problem Framing:* Building a model that learns to generate the optimized signal taking the traffic situations in mind. And it does this automatically without outside intereferance. This also takes feedbacks which further gets feeded and helps the model improve.

- **Anomaly/Incident Detection:**
  
  - *Goal:* When any accident happens on the road, our system should be able to recognize the accident immediately and users will be alerted.
  
  - *ML Problem Framing:* Learning from data of accident images and training a model that can differentiate between an image with accident and withour accident.
